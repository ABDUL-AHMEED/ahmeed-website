<p><h1><strong> FEMALE CIRCUMTION SHOULD BE ABOLISHED</strong></h1></p>
<h2> good day ladies and jentleman pannel of judies accurate time keeper and my co-debators my name is 
    ITJANI ABDUL-AHMEED OJO i will support the motion which sayes "female circumcition be abolished"
 </h2>
          <h2>i rembered a story of a girl who lived whith her step mother happly till one day she was
           called uppon by the village elders because she is know of age to do the female circumcition but 
           she was not updated about the quanciquence of what she was asked to do but after the circumcition
           the girl was not okey she  terrified; she did not know where she was. she was in 
           terrible pain; her genital area was all swollen and hurt all the time. Later she was told that the 
           infibulation had been cut open to let the urine and the pus out. she was terribly weak, and she did not 
           care anymore and that lead to the end of the girl.
</h2>
<h2>so know what is <strong> female circumcition</strong> it is the partial or complete removal
    of the external female genital organs. It is done for cultural rather than medical reasons.
know what is abolished this can be defined as the prosess inwhich do away withsomething or get raid of something or 
elimenate something </h2>
<h2> it is said that during the fifth centuary bc <strong> female circumcition</strong> started and femalebegans to die every day that pass like 
    they can conferm 22 female death cases caused by that so called female circumcition 
    girls suffars from terrifieing pain the worse part is that is is also done among marred woman and know if i am askwd y is it 
    carryed out ? simple it out just to control female sexuality but if killing someone controls the way a perform sex then what 
    is the piont of doing it they reather kill them because if a ersons genetal patr is compleatly removed it is possible for the 
    persons uninery systerm to be affected 
</h2>
<h2>but all those where happenig because there is no good ruleng of people thise days female go through different chalenges in nigeria 
    during those days </h2>
    <h2>in conclution all female out there should not get thir self practising <strong>female circumcition </strong>because it can be the end of onces life 
        whith this point i hv laied so far i think i hv been able to give u reasons y female circomsition should be abolished .
    <strong>thanks</strong>
